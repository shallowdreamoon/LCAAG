# LCAAG
The implementation of LCAAG.
### Source Code
The source code of LCAAG, which is illustrated with the Cora dataset as an example.
The eventual purpose of LCAAG is to obtain the optimal clusters assignment matrix of the nodes for AG clustering.
### Datasets
All the attributed graph datasets used in our paper.
### Evaluation Metric Code
The code for solving the evaluation metrics.
Its main inputs are the optimal clusters assignment matrix obtained by LCAAG and the ground_truth of the original data in the dataset.
